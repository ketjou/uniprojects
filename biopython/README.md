Biological Data with Python (Biopython)

This folder contains exercises completed for the course BIOI4270 Bioinformatics Programming. All exercises were done using Python in a Jupyter environment, and each exercise was implemented from scratch following the lectures.

Please note that the files are unreviewed: comments directed at the instructor have been left intact, and some sub-tasks may be incomplete or contain incorrect solutions. The project work was created entirely from scratch without a template, using only the methods learned during the course.

Some notebooks may require external datasets to run properly.
