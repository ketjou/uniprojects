Biological data with Python (Biopython)

This folder holds the exercises done in the course BIOI4270 Bioinformatics Programming Course.
The files are in Jupyter -format and each exercise is done from scratch after the lectures.
Files are unscrutinized, meaning that eg. the comments addressed to the lecturer are left as such
also there might be some sub-tasks that haven't been complished or have a wrong solution.
No template preceded the projectwork, it was done totally from scratch using the learnt methods.
Some of the files may require external datasets to run.
