Structural Bioinformatics

This folder contains files from course BIOI4240 Structural Bioinformatics.
Course covered using PDB and analyzing protein structures with UCSF Chimera.
The 4 minute video done with UCSF Chimera command line describes the structural features
of the human LPL-GPIHBP1 protein (6OB0).
The project work holds many snapshots and code snippets, along with descriptions. The tasks were used during the course and
they give insight of the Chimera using skills and moreover how the structural analysis can be done with the program.
